      question: "How do you vet candidates?",
      answer: "We run a rigorous 4-step process: initial screening, cultural fit assessment, technical validation (often involving live coding or take-home assignments tailored to your stack), and English proficiency testing. We only present candidates who pass all stages."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the typical time-to-hire?",
      answer: "Our average time-to-hire is 14 days from the kickoff call to the accepted offer. We maintain an active network of passive candidates, allowing us to move much faster than traditional recruiting methods."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you handle payroll and compliance?",
      answer: "Yes. Depending on the model you choose (Staffing/EOR), we can handle all local compliance, payroll, benefits administration, and taxes, allowing you to focus purely on managing the talent."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if a hire doesn't work out?",
      answer: "We offer a 90-day replacement guarantee. If the candidate is not a fit within the first three months, we will run a new search and replace them at no additional cost."
    },
    {
      question: "Are the engineers fluent in English?",
      answer: "Absolutely. We only work with candidates who have advanced or fluent English proficiency, ensuring seamless communication with your US-based team."
